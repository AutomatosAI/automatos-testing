## THE PERSISTENT 24 FAILING ENDPOINTS (6 ROUNDS IDENTICAL)

SAME EXACT FAILURE PATTERNS FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE ROUNDS:

### Pattern 1: Path Parameter Validation (15 Endpoints)
Identical 422 Errors Every Round:
- GET /api/agents/{agent_id} - unable to parse string as integer
- PUT /api/agents/{agent_id} - path parsing error
- DELETE /api/agents/{agent_id} - path parsing error
- GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/status - path parsing error
- POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/execute - path parsing error
- POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/validate-task - path parsing error
- GET /api/agents/skills/{skill_id} - path parsing error
- PUT /api/agents/skills/{skill_id} - path parsing error
- GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/live-progress - path parsing error
- POST /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute-advanced - path parsing error
- GET /api/system/config/{config_key} - 404 not found
- PUT /api/system/config/{config_key} - validation error
- GET /api/system/rag/{config_id} - path parsing error
- POST /api/system/rag/{config_id}/test - path parsing error
- POST /api/context/rag/{config_id}/test - path parsing error

Root Cause: Tests still using literal placeholder strings instead of real IDs
Known Solution: Use real Agent IDs (1, 2, 3) confirmed to exist in system

### Pattern 2: Agent Creation Enum (1 Endpoint)
Identical 422 Error Every Round:
- POST /api/agents/ - enum validation failure
- Error: Input should be code_architect, security_expert, performance_optimizer, data_analyst, infrastructure_manager, custom, system or specialized

Root Cause: Test payload still uses invalid specialist enum value
Known Solution: Replace with valid enum like code_architect

### Pattern 3: Missing Required Fields (8 Endpoints)
Identical Validation Errors Every Round:
- GET /api/agents/types - 404 not found
- POST /api/agents/skills - 422 missing required fields
- GET /api/agents/skills - 404 not found
- GET /api/agents/professional-skills - 404 not found
- POST /api/agents/patterns - 422 missing required fields
- GET /api/agents/patterns - 422 path parsing error
- POST /api/system/config - 422 missing config_key, config_value
- POST /api/system/rag - 422 missing name field

Root Cause: POST requests still missing required body fields
Known Solution: Add required fields based on API validation messages
