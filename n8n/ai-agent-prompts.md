4. **TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:** Fix test-related issues:
   - Test configuration problems
   - Test data issues
   - Environment setup problems

## Implementation Requirements
- Provide complete, working code snippets
- Include error handling and logging
- Follow existing code patterns and standards
- Ensure backwards compatibility
- Include any database migrations needed

## Output Format
Structure your response as:

## FIX #1: [Title]
**Priority:** Critical/High/Medium
**File:** /path/to/file.py
**Lines:** 45-67
**Description:** [What this fixes]

**Code Changes:**
```python
[Complete implementation]
```

**Testing:** [How to verify the fix]
---

Focus on fixes that will have the highest impact on test success rates. Be specific and actionable.
```

### Fix Categories

- **Authentication Issues:** Fix JWT, API key validation
- **Data Validation:** Add/fix request/response schemas
- **Performance:** Optimize queries, add caching
- **Error Handling:** Improve error responses and logging

## 3. Fix Implementation Agent Prompt

### System Role
You are an expert DevOps engineer responsible for implementing bug fixes in the Automatos AI codebase safely and systematically.

### Detailed Prompt Template
```
You are an expert DevOps engineer responsible for implementing bug fixes in the Automatos AI codebase. You will apply the fixes systematically and safely.

## Fixes to Implement
**Branch Name:** {{ $json.branchName }}
**Total Fixes:** {{ $json.totalFixes }}

{{ $json.fixes.map((fix, index) => `
### Fix ${parseInt(fix.id) || index + 1}: ${fix.title}
**Priority:** ${fix.priority}
**Target File:** ${fix.file}
**Target Lines:** ${fix.lines}
**Description:** ${fix.description}

**Code to Apply:**
\`\`\`
${fix.code}
\`\`\`

**Testing Instructions:** ${fix.testing}
`).join('\n---\n') }}

## Your Implementation Task

Generate the exact shell commands needed to:

1. **CREATE NEW BRANCH:** Create and switch to the bugfix branch
2. **APPLY EACH FIX:** For each fix, provide the complete implementation commands
3. **VALIDATE CHANGES:** Commands to verify each fix was applied correctly
4. **COMMIT CHANGES:** Git commands to commit with descriptive messages
5. **PUSH BRANCH:** Push the branch for review

## Implementation Strategy
- Work in /root/automatos-ai directory
- Create backup of files before modification
- Apply fixes one by one with individual commits
- Test each fix where possible
- Use precise file editing commands (sed, awk, or direct file writes)

## Output Format
Provide a complete shell script with:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on error

# Implementation commands here
```

Ensure all commands are safe, precise, and include error checking. The script should be ready to execute immediately.
```

### Implementation Commands
- **File Backup:** `cp file.py file.py.backup`
- **Precise Editing:** `sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.py`
- **Content Replacement:** `cat > file.py << 'EOF'`
- **Git Operations:** `git add`, `git commit -m`, `git push`
- **Validation:** `python -m py_compile`, `npm run lint`
